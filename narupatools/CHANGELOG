# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2021-11-22
### Changed
- Support Narupa version 0.1.2085, and hence OpenMM >= 7.6.0

## [2.0.0] - 2021-09-22
### Added
- Session can take a target as a first argument, to be used as the initial thing to broadcast
- Session has an autoplay argument, which automatically plays the initial target if present
- FrameProducer has an always_dirty property, which is set by the Session when the target does not implement FrameSourceWithNotify. This means that the session has no idea when frames are being changed, so it will err on the safe side and assume all fields are always dirty.
- Subclasses of TrajectorySource can override the _create_from_object class method. When TrajectorySource.create_from_object is called, all subclasses are checked to see if they can convert this arbitrary object to a TrajectorySource. This avoids the middle step of creating something such as an MDAnalysisTrajectory.

### Changed
- Changed how information about which fields of a frame are dirty is communicated. Now, the Session is not involved and instead there is a subclass of FrameSource which provides an event notifying listeners of any changes. This puts the onus on objects like the dynamics to inform listeners when certain fields change.
- Can use narupatools with OpenMM installed
- Unified ASETrajectory, MDAnalysisTrajectory and MDTrajTrajectory as all subclasses of TrajectorySource
- Instead of subclassing TrajectoryPlayback, now one unified TrajectoryPlayback can play any instance of a TrajectorySource

### Fixed
- More exceptions use the ... as ... and ... from ... pattern.

## [1.1.3] - 2021-08-06
### Added
- Documentation now tested with CI using doctest

### Changed
- Wrap certain LAMMPS errors in more specific types, such as MissingInputScriptError or UnrecognizedStyleError

### Fixed
- Fixed lammps_gather_atoms call to use correct enums due to LAMMPS API change.

## [1.1.2] - 2021-05-07
### Fixed
- OpenMMDynamics reset was not reseting the simulation correctly.

## [1.1.1] - 2021-05-07
### Added
- narupatools.core.timing for checking predicates at an interval until a timeout. Useful for replacing fixed time.sleep calls in tests.

### Fixed
- Bug with OpenMM calculator where observers were added every frame. Now there is only up to one ASEObserver per Atoms.
- Tests were using wait_until_next_frame wrong.
- Sessions in tests use the run_discovery=False flag to avoid wasting time starting the discovery server.
- Add lock for ASEDynamics to prevent read/write to atoms at same time.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-05-06
### Added
- Added a `start_loop` function to Session, which does the standard infinite loop with health checking and keyboard interrupting.

### Changed
- Playable.run gained typing overloads.
- When a Playable is cancelled, the fact it was cancelled is now stored locally within the method.
- HDF5Writer will throw an error instead of overwriting a file.

### Fixed
- VERSION was not include in python package.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-05-05
### Added
- Now a conda recipe!

### Changed
- Massive refactors and changes

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-10
### Changed
- Initial release of code
